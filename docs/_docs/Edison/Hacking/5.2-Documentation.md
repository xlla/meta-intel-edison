## Creating a documentation page
Go to docs/_docs/Edison/dir/ and copy a file as a template. The files are in mark down format. 
You can use for instance ReText as a mark down editor.

Rules:
  * Keep the file name without spaces.
  * In the header of the file after `permalink` use the same file base name and end with html.
  * In docs/_data/edison.yml add a new `-title` under `folderitems`.
  * Start the server in `docs/` with `jekyll server --incremental`.
  * Point your web browser to `http://localhost:4000/`.
